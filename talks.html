                    <p><b>Abstract:</b> The local behavior of a holomorphic function at a critical point is described by the Milnor fibration. We explain how the ideal generated by the function's partial derivatives in the local power series ring can be used to obtain information about this behavior, and in particular its variation in families, for arbitrary-dimensional singularities.</p>

                    <p><b>Abstract:</b> What can we say about the topology of the level sets of a homogeneous polynomial, or of a holomorphic function locally near a critical point? As it turns out, a lot less than you'd hope! We will discuss a new way of approaching the problem using machinery from algebraic (and complex-analytic) geometry.</p>

For an arbitrary-dimensional singularity, perturbation is no longer guaranteed to preserve the Milnor fiber, making an analogous approach difficult.

                    <p><b>Abstract:</b> The Zariski topology is pretty cool, but, if we're working over the complex numbers, we can also think about the classical topology we're used to from other areas of math. In this talk, we'll discuss analytification, the process of passing from an algebraic variety (or scheme) to the corresponding classical object (or complex-analytic space), and touch on various facts about the relationship between the two, such as Serre's GAGA principle. If time permits, we'll also talk a little about tools we can use to gain insight about varieties once we've analytified them, such as the theory of stratifications.</p>

                    <p><b>Abstract:</b> Given a holomorphic family of function germs defining hypersurface singularities, we can ask whether the Milnor fiber varies consistently; in the isolated case, it is well-known that the answer is always yes (in the sense that the family defines a fibration above the complement of the discriminant), and this allows us to obtain a distinguished basis of vanishing cycles for a singularity by perturbing it slightly. In the non-isolated case, this is not always true, and there has long been interest in finding conditions under which this kind of consistency does occur. We give a powerful algebraic condition which is sufficient for this purpose - namely, that the analogous statement will hold so long as the critical locus of the family, considered as an analytic scheme, is flat over the parameter space.</p>

                    <p><b>Notes:</b> The original abstract of this talk is lost to time, but it is mainly a roundup of various results on the topology of the Milnor fibration. Also, I was not aware of this at the time, but it should be noted that the quantity discussed at the start of Section IV is actually a case of a known concept, the multiplicity of a prime ideal in a module. This can be found in Section 3.6 of <a href="https://eisenbud.github.io/">David Eisenbud</a>'s <i>Commutative Algebra with a View Toward Algebraic Geometry</i>.</i></p>

                    <p><b>Abstract:</b> Early on in the semester, Colin told us a bit about Morse Theory, and how it lets us get a handle on the (classical) topology of smooth complex varieties. As we all know, however, not everything in life goes smoothly, and so too in algebraic geometry. Singular varieties, when given the classical topology, are not manifolds, but they can be described in terms of manifolds by means of something called a Whitney stratification. This allows us to develop a version of Morse Theory that applies to singular spaces (and also, with a bit of work, to smooth spaces that fail to be nice in other ways, like non-compact manifolds!), called Stratified Morse Theory. After going through the appropriate definitions and briefly reviewing the results of classical Morse Theory, we'll discuss the so-called Main Theorem of Stratified Morse Theory and survey some of its consequences.</p>

                    <p><b>Title:</b> Tropicalization Blues</p>
                    <p><b>Date:</b> November 13, 2019</p>
                    <p><b>Venue:</b> <a href="https://wiki.math.wisc.edu/index.php/Graduate_Algebraic_Geometry_Seminar">University of Wisconsin-Madison Graduate Algebraic Geometry Seminar</a></p>
                    <p><b>Abstract:</b> Tropicalization turns algebro-geometric objects into piecewise linear ones which can then be studied through the lens of combinatorics. In this talk, I will introduce the basic construction, then discuss some of the recent efforts to generalize and improve upon it, touching upon the Giansiracusa tropicalization and <s>developing</s> gazing wistfully in the direction of the machinery of ordered blueprints necessary for the Lorscheid tropicalization.</p>
                    <p><b>Notes:</b> Turns out I didn't do so hot estimating the timing on this one, so we didn't get anywhere close to the ordered blueprint stuff. This is a framework due to <a href="https://oliver.impa.br/">Oliver Lorscheid</a> which essentially lets one formalize various notions of tropicalization as base changes in an appropriate category; if you'd like to learn more, I wrote <a href="sp2020_finalproj.pdf">this summary</a> for <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/dcorey2814/">Dan Corey</a>'s <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/dcorey2814/teaching/math-863-spring-2020">Introduction to Tropical Geometry</a> course in Spring 2020.</p>

                    <p><b>Title:</b> Kindergarten GAGA</p>
                    <p><b>Date:</b> April 10, 2019</p>
                    <p><b>Venue:</b> <a href="https://wiki.math.wisc.edu/index.php/Graduate_Algebraic_Geometry_Seminar">University of Wisconsin-Madison Graduate Algebraic Geometry Seminar</a></p>
                    <p><b>Abstract:</b> Join me in regressing to an infantile state as we discuss Serre's 1956 paper <i>Algebraic geometry and analytic geometry</i>, widely considered to be the most influential work ever authored by a mathematician under the age of five. We will define the notion of an analytic space, construct the analytic space associated to any algebraic variety over C, and examine the relationships between the two, including the equivalence between coherent algebraic sheaves and coherent analytic sheaves in the projective case.</p>
                    <p><b>Notes:</b> This abstract is not entirely serious. In fact, Serre was over five years old when he wrote GAGA.</p>
